# 🕵️‍♂️ AnonX

AnonX is a minimal, privacy-focused web platform where users can **share** and **reveal secrets** — anonymously.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 Post secrets anonymously
- 👀 Reveal random or trending secrets
- 🧾 No sign-up required
- 💻 Built using modern web stack (Next.js, React)
- 🌙 Dark-mode UI (optional)
- 🛡️ Privacy-first (no tracking, no analytics by default)
